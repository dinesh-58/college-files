* Introduction
#+LATEX:\pagenumbering{arabic}
** Introduction
During my internship, I worked on multiple projects, mostly using the WordPress platform and Elementor page builder.
WordPress is a popular, flexible \acrfull{cms} that is used for building a variety of websites. Elementor is a tool for
WordPress that allows building an entire website using a \acrfull{gui} editor i.e. without needing to write much code.
This tech stack is preferred by the company to meet their needs for a fast, scalable and easy-to-edit way to build client
websites.

At first, I did basic tasks on Sasto Nordic's e-commerce store. Doing so made me familiar with WordPress, Elementor &
WooCommerce, and understand how the WordPress ecosystem could be used to build a variety of websites. When there was a
relatively simple project for a dental clinic, I was assigned to work on the majority of it. I learned to setup a local
WordPress development environment, publishing websites to a cloud host and domain, and best practices for devloping
collaboratively and avoiding conflicts.

After becoming proficient with the company's WordPress workflow, I was asked to handle website changes and maintenance
requests for one of the company's long-term clients: GLOHMED, a global health research institute here in Nepal.
Implementing all their requests taught me more advanced concepts of WordPress and \acrfull{css}, and I was able to improve
the site's design, and optimize it by replacing third-party plugins with better native features in WordPress and Elementor.
I also worked on developing an email newsletter template for them.

After working with mostly low-code tools, I also worked on a few code projects. I contributed to the company's website,
which was built with Astro, a JavaScript framework for building websites, web-apps in a flexible manner. I was also tasked 
with building a small project, for which I made a web-app for foreign language exams  where non-technical people could
easily edit the questions. 

** Problem Statement
+ *Sasto Nordic*: As it is an e-commerce business, the website is the core of the business and without it, the owners would
  have to rely on 3rd-party platforms that charge fees and limit customization.

+ *Dental clinic & GLOHMED*: Both of these clients need their website to provide all necessary info about themselves in a central place, and create an online presence to improve search results in their fields. In GLOHMED's case, a custom website
  is the most suitable platform for managing all their online content (such as academic research, event reports).

+ *Language exam web-app*: There aren't many good quality exam-taking apps for non-english languages such as Korean. Such a project could help create a better exam experience for examinees, examiners and other parties (teachers, consultancies) through anti-cheat measures, automated grading, ease of updating questions etc.

** Objectives
- To gain practical experience in building and managing websites using WordPress at a professional level
- To develop skills in modern web development by working with frameworks like Astro and Next.js.
- To improve understanding of web performance, scalability, and best practices for deploying professional websites.

** Scope and Limitation
*** Scope
During the internship, I worked mostly with WordPress and Elementor to develop & maintain websites.
This involved leveraging the WordPress ecosystem, complemented by fundamental web technologies such as \acrfull{html},
\acrfull{css}, JavaScript to construct responsive and performant digital websites.
WordPress and its ecosystem were new for me, so I had to learn them from the start and how to work with it to meet client
needs. A key aspect of my role was tailoring WordPress installations through theme and plugin customization to align
precisely with individual client specifications. Furthermore, I actively collaborated with designers and other developers
to refine website features and user experience. My responsibilities also extended to the ongoing maintenance of these web
platforms, including identifying and resolving technical issues, as well as implementing optimizations to enhance site
speed and search engine visibility.

*** Limitation
- Lack of technically complex projects as most clients only wanted informational, easy to update business website.
- Focused mainly on frontend and low-code tools

** Description of Intern Department / Unit
During my internship, I was placed in the Development department and worked under the guidance of the existing developers.
This department handles the technical side of the business, from client projects to IT infrastructure for the company.
As such, I learned not only about working on client projects, but also various technical aspects of a business such as
collaborating with a team, project management, secure hosting & deployment etc.

* Background Study and Literature Review
** Background Study
During my internship period, I observed that the company preferred to use low-code development tools, especially WordPress
and Elementor for the majority of their client projects, which were informational websites for businesses. An introduction
to these tools and their benefits is given below.

*** Low-Code Development Tools
These platforms offer visual interfaces and pre-configured components that allow individuals with varying degrees of technical skill to develop applications and websites with reduced reliance on traditional coding practices. Advantages of low-code development include:
- accelerated development cycles,
- enhanced accessibility for non-technical people,
- cost efficiency

Some popular low-code development tools include:

- *Webflow*: A powerful platform that allows for the visual design and building of responsive websites without writing code. It offers extensive control over UI, animations, and interactions, and includes a built-in CMS.

- *Shopify*: Specifically designed for building e-commerce websites, offering a user-friendly interface for creating online stores, managing products, and processing payments.

- *Wix*: A popular website builder with a drag-and-drop interface and a wide range of templates suitable for various types of websites, including business sites, portfolios, and online stores.

  
*** WordPress
Originating as a blogging platform in 2003, WordPress has evolved into a versatile \acrfull{cms} capable of supporting a diverse range of web applications, including personal blogs, business websites, e-commerce platforms, and complex enterprise solutions.
A \acrshort{cms} is a software application that enables users to create, manage, and modify digital content—most commonly posts, media on websites—without needing to write code from scratch.
Wordpress' utility is significantly enhanced by its comprehensive ecosystem, which includes a wide selection of pre-designed and adaptable themes, a collection of plugins extending core functionalities, and a collaborative global community contributing to its open-source development and support.
The company preferred WordPress for developing most of their websites, as it allowed a familiar and easy way of managing
website content in a scalable way, as well as flexibility to develop a large variety of websites.

*** Elementor
Elementor is a widely adopted, drag-and-drop page builder plugin for WordPress. It allows low-code development on top of the WordPress ecosystem, enabling users to create visually engaging and highly functional websites without coding proficiency. Elementor includes an intuitive visual interface, an extensive library of widgets and templates, high customizability, and easy responsive design capabilities. It also offers many useful features in its free tier, providing a cost-effective way to build large websites quickly and intuitively. As such, the company choose Elementor for developing most of their
projects due to its low cost as well as being a simple tool to teach to new hires.

** Literature Review
# review of similar projects 
Low code tools are preferred by developers to speed up as well as simplify development. A 2023 study[cite:@low_code] found
that 81.8% of participants agreed that development with low code tools is faster and more agile. Neutral/disagree responses
came from practitioners with some knowledge about coding, arguing that "...similar apps can be done as fast with
traditional coding".

The same study showed that 63.6% of participants agreed such platforms provided cost-saving measures, and 91.9% said they
also reduced development complexity, allowing even "non-IT people to build low-code apps". Major concerns and drawbacks 
expressed by the participants include:

- lack of customizability
- vendor lock-in
- scalability

Conversely, a 2022 research study[cite:@dev_research] conducted among 193 developers showed that about 6% preferred to
start a project using low / no-code tools, with a majority citing the inflexibility of such systems for developing
unique, customizable systems or when dealing with a lack of clearly defined requirements.

Regardless, low code tools are highly preferred in situations where they are most useful / applicable. An  example
of this is a majority of websites that are informational in nature, or have commonly used features such as blogging,
account signups, ecommerce capabilities, payment processing etc. This covers a significant part of websites on the internet,
as evidenced by how WordPress powers around 521 million websites i.e. 43.5% of all websites on the internet, according to a report by WPZoom[cite:@wp_stats]. Meanwhile, a 2025 statistics report[cite:@cms_stats] showed that roughly 70% of active websites use an
existing \acrshort{cms} to simplify development and organize content. A majority of that is made up of WordPress sites,
with others like Wix, SquareSpace having been used. Such figures show that even experienced developers
choose low-code platforms to meet business needs within given time, budget constraints whenever they are applicable.

The majority of the projects at the company and the ones I worked on, were developed using WordPress, showcasing its
flexibility due to its customizable nature and a well-designed core CMS structure[cite:@wp_cms] for content management. 
However, WordPress wasn't suitable for some projects like the language testing web app I worked on, which relied heavily on
client-side logic. As such, WordPress and other low-code tools may or may not be the best choice for a project, depending
on whether the requirements can be met by the tool's features.

* Internship Activities
** Roles and Responsibilities
Overall, my responsibilities were as such: 

- Developing responsive websites using WordPress, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to ensure optimal performance across devices.
- Customizing WordPress themes and plugins to meet specific client requirements.
- Collaborating with the design and content teams to improve website UI/UX and ensure seamless user experience.
- Performing website maintenance tasks, debugging issues, and optimizing site speed and SEO performance.

|--------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 4 (Dec 22-Dec 27)  | As the project was simple, I was assigned to work on the homepage. By doing this, I learned to setup a local WordPress development environment, migrate it to a cloud host, as well as advanced WordPress features like custom post types, and archive templates.                                                                               |
|--------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 5 (Dec 29-Jan 03)  | I was asked to handle minor website maintenance requests for a long-term client. As per their requests, I modified existing templates, added new posts, and learned advanced CSS to implement some designs.                                                                                                                         |
|--------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 6 (Jan 05-Jan 10)  | The client wished to start an email newsletter. I was tasked to research email builders that would suit our needs and settled on Blocks.

** Description of the Projects Involved During the Internship
*** Sasto Nordic's e-commerce store
Sasto Nordic was a unique startup selling Nepali products such as food, clothing items in the Danish market, namely
Denmark, Norway and Sweden. They focused on promoting and selling a wide range of Nepali grocery items to recreate
traditional dishes and celebrate Nepali culture. To help them in their mission to uplift Nepali
heritage, the company collaborated with them to develop an online e-commerce store as well as work together on any of
their digital needs.
I was given basic tasks for this project such as data entry, testing edge cases, and making simple template
modifications to familiarize me with WordPress, Elementor & WooCommerce as well as the company's WordPress workflow.

*** Tarkeshwar Dental's website
I participated in client meetings to understand client needs for a new website project and how to address them.
This early involvement in planning and design showed me how substantial projects are professionally started and planned.
The client needed a single page website to showcase information about their dental clinic, their services as well as
publish blog posts to provide information and improve \acrfull{seo}.
Due to its simple nature, I was asked to work on the majority of it to gain further proficiency.
I learned to setup a local WordPress development, deploy WordPress sites to the web, and learned collaborative development workflows to avoid conflicts.

*** GLOHMED
GLOHMED is a research organization in Nepal, committed to advancing clinical medicine and global health, with a long-term vision to improve quality of patient care and health outcomes in low-resource settings. They had been a long-term client,
with the company having provided various digital services, ranging from website maintenance to video editing and graphic design. Their website mainly focused on providing information about themselves, posting about research articles they had
published, as well as providing general updates about the organization.

After becoming proficient in WordPress, I was asked to handle website change requests for GLOHMED. Implementing all their
requests taught me more advanced concepts of WordPress and CSS, and I was able to improve the site's design, and optimize
it by replacing 3rd-party plugins with better native features in WordPress and Elementor. I was also asked to design an
easy to edit email newsletter template for them, so I researched the best ways to do so, learning about email builders
and how HTML needs to be used differently for emails than for websites.

*** Foreign language exam web app
During my final month, I was tasked to come up with a small project idea, and I deicded to make a web-app for foreign
language exams where non-technical people could easily edit the questions. I was taught how to make project prototypes
quickly using NextJS and SQLite as the tech stack, and as such, I decided to use them to build the project. I decided to
make it after hearing complaints from consultancies and examinees about how there wasn't a well-made app for organizing 
and taking tests for non-English languages like Korean. I leveraged the SurveyJS library for an existing way to create 
and edit question model sets in a visual editor, and incorporated it with NextJS to add future server-side features like
dynamic page templates for similar model sets, user account system, payment features etc.

I was able to make a small demo to showcase the potential for such an app using mock questions from Korean EPS language
tests, with a base to further improve it. The demo included the following features:

- Allow admins / exam instructors to easily create question sets through SurveyJS
- Show a list of available question sets to users
- Start timed MCQ test with reading & listening questions
- Automatically grade answers & store test record in a Google Sheet and local database for easy access

* Conclusion and Learning Outcomes
** Conclusion
In summary, this internship involved active participation in the full lifecycle of real-world projects, primarily utilizing
the WordPress platform and associated low-code tools for client website development and maintenance. My contributions
ranged from initial client requirement analysis and project planning to hands-on implementation, deployment, and ongoing optimization. Additionally, I gained introductory experience with modern JavaScript frameworks for building more specialized web applications. Overall, it was a valuable experience to learn new things as well as solidify previously learned
web-development concepts. As such, I am grateful to have completed this internship as part of my coursework.

** Learning Outcome
Through the course of this internship, I gained practical experience in using the WordPress ecosystem, including its 
\acrfull{php}-based core library, theme customization, and utilizing its plugins for building and maintaining client
websites. I developed proficiency in leveraging low-code tools like Elementor to rapidly build websites in a visual manner.
Furthermore, I acquired foundational knowledge in setting up local WordPress development environments, deploying websites
to live servers, and adhering to collaborative development practices. This hands-on engagement provided a tangible
understanding of the process involved in delivering web solutions for real-world clients. Additionally, my brief exposure
to modern JavaScript frameworks such as Astro and Next.js introduced me to alternative approaches for building
more custom, complex web applications.
