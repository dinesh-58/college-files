* Introduction
#+LATEX:\pagenumbering{arabic}
** Introduction
During my internship, I worked on multiple projects, mostly using the WordPress platform and Elementor page builder. WordPress is a popular, flexible \acrfull{cms} that is used for building a variety of websites. Elementor is a tool for WordPress that allows building an entire website using a GUI editor i.e. without needing to write much code. This tech stack is preferred by the company to meet their needs for a fast, scalable and easy-to-edit way to build client websites.

At first, I did basic tasks on Sasto Nordic's e-commerce store.
Doing so made me familiar with WordPress, Elementor & WooCommerce, and understand how the WordPress ecosystem could be used to build a variety of websites. When there was a relatively simple project for a dental clinic, I was assigned to work on the majority of it. I learned to setup a local WordPress development environment, publishing websites to a cloud host and domain, and best practices for devloping collaboratively and avoiding conflicts.

After becoming proficient with the company's WordPress workflow, I was asked to handle website changes and maintenance for
one of the company's long-term clients: GLOHMED, a global health research institute here in Nepal. Implementing all their
requests taught me more advanced concepts of WordPress and CSS, and I was able to improve the site's design, and optimize it
by replacing 3rd-party plugins with better native features in WordPress and Elementor. I also worked on developing an
email newsletter template for them.

After working with mostly low-code tools, I also worked on a few code projects. I contributed to the company's website,
which was built with Astro, a JavaScript framework for building websites, web-apps in a flexible manner. I was also tasked 
with building a small project, for which I made a web-app for foreign language exams  where non-technical people could easily edit the questions. 

** Problem Statement
+ *Sasto Nordic*: As it is an e-commerce business, the website is the core of the business and without it, the owners would
  have to rely on 3rd-party platforms that charge fees and limit customization.

+ *Dental clinic & GLOHMED*: Both of these clients need their website to provide all necessary info about themselves in a central place, and create an online presence to improve search results in their fields. In GLOHMED's case, a custom website
  is the most suitable platform for managing all their online content (such as academic research, event reports).

+ *Language exam web-app*: There aren't many good quality exam-taking apps for non-english languages such as Korean. Such a project could help create a better exam experience for examinees, examiners and other parties (teachers, consultancies) by through anti-cheat measures, automated grading, ease of updating questions etc.

** Objectives
- To gain practical experience in building and managing websites using WordPress at a professional level
- To develop skills in modern web development by working with frameworks like Astro and Next.js.
- To improve understanding of web performance, scalability, and best practices for deploying professional websites.

** Scope and Limitation
*** Scope
During the internship, I worked mostly with WordPress and Elementor to develop & maintain websites.

This involved leveraging the WordPress ecosystem, complemented by fundamental web technologies such as \acrfull{html}, \acrfull{css}, JavaScript to construct responsive and performant digital websites. 
WordPress and its ecosystem were new for me, so I had to learn them from the start and how to work with it to meet client needs.
A key aspect of my role was tailoring WordPress installations through theme and plugin customization to align precisely with individual client specifications. Furthermore, I actively collaborated with designers and other developers to refine
website features and user experience. My responsibilities also extended to the ongoing upkeep of these web platforms, including identifying and resolving technical issues, as well as implementing optimizations to enhance site speed and search engine visibility.


*** Limitation
- Lack of technically complex projects as most clients only wanted informational, easy to update business website.
- Focused mainly on frontend and low-code tools

** Description of the Projects Involved During the Internship
*** Sasto Nordic's e-commerce store
At first, I was assigned basic tasks on Sasto Nordic's e-commerce store. It was a unique startup selling Nepali products
in the Danish market, namely Denmark, Norway and Sweden. They focused on promoting and selling a wide range of Nepali grocery items to recreate traditional dishes and celebrate Nepali culture. To help them in their mission to uplift Nepali
heritage, the company collaborated with them to provide an online store as well as work together on any of their digital
needs. I was given basic tasks for this project such as data entry, testing edge cases, and making simple template
modifications to familiarize me with WordPress, Elementor & WooCommerce as well as the company's WordPress workflow.

*** Tarkeshwar Dental's website
I participated in client meetings to understand client needs for a new website project and how to address them.
This early involvement in planning and design showed me how substantial projects are professionally started and planned.
The client needed a single page website to showcase information about their dental clinic, their services as well as
publish blog posts to provide information and boost \acrfull{seo}.
Due to its simple nature, I was asked to work on the majority of it to gain further proficiency.
I learned to setup a local WordPress development, deploy WordPress sites to the web, and learned collaborative development workflows to avoid conflicts.

*** GLOHMED
GLOHMED is a research company in Nepal, committed to advancing clinical medicine and global health, with a long-term vision to improve quality of patient care and health outcomes in low-resource settings. They had been a long-term client, with
the company having provided various digital services, ranging from website maintenance to video editing and graphic design.

After becoming proficient in WordPress, I was asked to handle website change requests for GLOHMED. Implementing all their
requests taught me more advanced concepts of WordPress and CSS, and I was able to improve the site's design, and optimize
it by replacing 3rd-party plugins with better native features in WordPress and Elementor. I was also asked to design an
easy to edit email newsletter template for them, so I researched the best ways to do so, learning about email builders
and how HTML needs to be used differently for emails than for websites.

*** Foreign language exam web app
During my final month, I was tasked to come up with a small project idea, and I deicded to make a web-app for foreign
language exams where non-technical people could easily edit the questions. I was taught how to make project prototypes
quickly using NextJS and SQLite as the tech stack, and as such, I decided to use them to build the project. I decided to
make it after hearing complaints from consultancies and examinees about how there wasn't a well-made app for organizing 
and taking tests for non-English languages like Korean. I leveraged the SurveyJS library for an existing way to create 
and edit question model sets in a visual editor, and incorporated it with NextJS to add future server-side features like
dynamic page templates for similar model sets, user account system, payment features etc. I was able to make a small demo
to showcase the potential for such an app, with a base to further improve it.

* Conclusion and Learning Outcomes
** Conclusion
In summary, this internship involved active participation in the full lifecycle of real-world projects, primarily utilizing
the WordPress platform and associated low-code tools for client website development and maintenance. My contributions
ranged from initial client requirement analysis and project planning to hands-on implementation, deployment, and ongoing optimization. Additionally, I gained introductory experience with modern JavaScript frameworks for building more specialized web applications. Overall, it was a valuable experience to learn new things as well as solidify previously learned
web-development concepts. As such, I am grateful to have completed this internship as part of my coursework.

** Learning Outcome
Through the course of this internship, I gained practical experience in using the WordPress ecosystem, including its 
\acrfull{php}-based core library, theme customization, and utilizing its plugins for building and maintaining client
websites. I developed proficiency in leveraging low-code tools like Elementor to rapidly build websites in a visual manner.
Furthermore, I acquired foundational knowledge in setting up local WordPress development environments, deploying websites
to live servers, and adhering to collaborative development practices. This hands-on engagement provided a tangible
understanding of the process involved in delivering web solutions for real-world clients. Additionally, my brief exposure
to modern JavaScript frameworks such as Astro and Next.js introduced me to alternative approaches for building
more custome, complex web applications.
