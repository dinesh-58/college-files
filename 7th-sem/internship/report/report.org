* Introduction
#+LATEX:\pagenumbering{arabic}
** Introduction
During my internship, I worked on multiple projects, mostly using the WordPress platform and Elementor page builder.
WordPress is a popular, flexible \acrfull{cms} that is used for building a variety of websites. Elementor is a tool for
WordPress that allows building an entire website using a \acrfull{gui} editor i.e. without needing to write much code.
These tools are preferred by the company to meet their needs for a fast, scalable and easy-to-edit way to build client
websites.

At first, I did basic tasks on Sasto Nordic's e-commerce store. Doing so made me familiar with WordPress, Elementor &
WooCommerce, and understand how the WordPress ecosystem could be used to build a variety of websites. When there was a
relatively simple project for a dental clinic, I was assigned to work on a majority of it. I learned to setup a local
WordPress development environment, publishing websites to a cloud host and domain, and best practices for devloping
collaboratively and avoiding conflicts.

After becoming proficient with the company's WordPress workflow, I was asked to handle website changes and maintenance
requests for one of the company's long-term clients: GLOHMED, a global health research institute here in Nepal.
Implementing all their requests taught me more advanced concepts of WordPress and \acrfull{css}, and I was able to improve
the site's design, and optimize it. I also worked on developing an email newsletter template for them.

After working with mostly low-code tools, I also worked on a few code projects. I contributed to the company's website,
which was built with Astro, a JavaScript framework for building websites, web-apps in a flexible manner. I was also tasked 
with building a small project, for which I made a web-app for foreign language exams  where non-technical people could
easily edit the questions. 

** Problem Statement
+ *Sasto Nordic*: As it is an e-commerce business, the website is the core of the business and without it, the owners would
  have to rely on 3rd-party platforms that charge fees and limit customization.

+ *Dental clinic & GLOHMED*: Both of these clients need their website to provide all necessary info about themselves in a central place, and create an online presence to improve search results in their fields. In GLOHMED's case, a custom website
  is the most suitable platform for managing all their online content (such as academic research, event reports).

+ *Language exam web-app*: There aren't many good quality exam-taking apps for non-english languages such as Korean. Such a project could help create a better exam experience for examinees, examiners and other parties (teachers, consultancies) through anti-cheat measures, automated grading, ease of updating questions etc.

** Objectives
- To gain practical experience in building and managing websites using WordPress at a professional level
- To develop skills in modern web development by working with frameworks like Astro and Next.js.
- To improve understanding of web performance, scalability, and best practices for deploying professional websites.

** Scope and Limitation

*** Scope
During the internship, I worked mostly with WordPress and Elementor to develop and maintain websites.
This involved leveraging the WordPress ecosystem, complemented by fundamental web technologies such as \acrfull{html},
\acrfull{css}, JavaScript to develop responsive and performant digital websites.
WordPress and its ecosystem were new for me, so I had to learn them from the start and how to work with it to meet client
needs. A key aspect of my role was tailoring WordPress installations through theme and plugin customizations to align
precisely with client specifications. Furthermore, I actively collaborated with designers and other developers
to refine website features and user experience. My responsibilities also extended to the ongoing maintenance of developed
websites, including identifying and resolving technical issues, as well as implementing optimizations to enhance site
speed and search engine visibility.

*** Limitation
- Lack of technically complex projects as most clients only wanted informational, easy to update business websites
- Focused mainly on frontend development and low-code tools

** Description of Intern Department / Unit
During my internship, I was placed in the Development department and worked under the guidance of the existing developers.
This department handles the technical side of the business, from client projects to IT infrastructure for the company.
As such, I learned not only about working on client projects, but also various technical aspects of a business such as
collaborating with a team, project management, secure hosting & deployment etc.

* Background Study and Literature Review
** Background Study
During my internship period, I observed that the company preferred to use low-code development tools, especially WordPress
and Elementor, for the majority of their client projects, which were informational websites for businesses. An introduction
to these tools and their benefits is given below.

*** Low-Code Development Tools
These platforms allow individuals with varying degrees of technical skill to develop applications and websites with reduced reliance on traditional coding practices, using visual interfaces and pre-configured components. Advantages of low-code development include:
- accelerated development cycles,
- enhanced accessibility for non-technical people,
- cost efficiency

Some popular low-code development tools include:

- *Webflow*: A powerful platform that allows for the visual design and building of responsive websites without writing code. It offers extensive control over UI, animations, and interactions, and includes a built-in CMS.

- *Shopify*: Specifically designed for building e-commerce websites, offering a user-friendly interface for creating online stores, managing products, and processing payments.

- *Wix*: A popular website builder with a drag-and-drop interface and a wide range of templates suitable for various types of websites, including business sites, portfolios, and online stores.

  
*** WordPress
Originating as a blogging platform in 2003, WordPress has evolved into a versatile \acrfull{cms} capable of supporting a diverse range of web applications, including personal blogs, business websites, e-commerce platforms, and complex enterprise solutions.
A \acrshort{cms} is a software application that enables users to create, manage, and modify digital content—most commonly posts, media on websites—without needing to write code from scratch.
Wordpress' utility is significantly enhanced by its comprehensive ecosystem, which includes a wide selection of pre-designed and adaptable themes, a collection of plugins extending core functionalities, and a collaborative global community contributing to its open-source development and support.
The company preferred WordPress for developing most of their websites, as it allowed a familiar and easy way of managing
website content in a scalable way, as well as flexibility to develop a large variety of websites.

*** Elementor
Elementor is a widely adopted, drag-and-drop page builder plugin for WordPress. It allows low-code development on top of the WordPress ecosystem, enabling users to create visually engaging and highly functional websites without coding proficiency. Elementor includes an intuitive visual interface, an extensive library of widgets and templates, high customizability, and easy responsive design capabilities. It also offers many useful features in its free tier, providing a cost-effective way to build large websites quickly and intuitively. As such, the company choose Elementor for developing most of their
projects due to its low cost as well as being a simple tool to teach to new hires.

** Literature Review
# review of similar projects 
Low code tools are preferred by developers to speed up as well as simplify development. A 2023 study[cite:@low_code] found
that 81.8% of participants agreed that development with low code tools is faster and more agile. Neutral/disagree responses
came from practitioners with some knowledge about coding, arguing that "...similar apps can be done as fast with
traditional coding".

The same study showed that 63.6% of participants agreed such platforms provided cost-saving measures, and 91.9% said they
also reduced development complexity, allowing even "non-IT people to build low-code apps". Major concerns and drawbacks 
expressed by the participants include:

- lack of customizability
- vendor lock-in
- scalability

Conversely, a 2022 research study[cite:@dev_research] conducted among 193 developers showed that about 6% preferred to
start a project using low / no-code tools, with a majority citing the inflexibility of such systems for developing
unique, customizable systems or when dealing with a lack of clearly defined requirements.

Regardless, low code tools are highly preferred in situations where they are most useful / applicable. An  example
of this is a majority of websites that are informational in nature, or have commonly used features such as blogging,
account signups, ecommerce capabilities, payment processing etc. This covers a significant part of websites on the internet,
as evidenced by how WordPress powers around 521 million websites i.e. 43.5% of all websites on the internet, according to a report by WPZoom[cite:@wp_stats]. Meanwhile, a 2025 statistics report[cite:@cms_stats] showed that roughly 70% of active websites use a
\acrshort{cms} to simplify development and organize content. A majority of that is made up of WordPress sites,
with others like Wix, SquareSpace also having been used. Such figures show that even experienced developers
choose low-code platforms to meet business needs within given time and budget constraints whenever they are applicable.

The majority of the projects at the company that I worked on were developed using WordPress, showcasing its
flexibility due to its customizable nature and a well-designed core CMS structure[cite:@wp_cms] for content management. 
However, WordPress wasn't suitable for some projects like the language testing web app I worked on, which relied heavily on
client-side logic. As such, WordPress and other low-code tools may or may not be the best choice for a project, depending
on whether the requirements can be met by the tool's features.

* Internship Activities
** Roles and Responsibilities
Overall, my responsibilities were as such: 

- Developing responsive websites using WordPress, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to ensure optimal performance across devices.
- Customizing WordPress themes and plugins to meet specific client requirements.
- Collaborating with the design and content teams to improve website UI/UX and ensure seamless user experience.
- Performing website maintenance tasks, debugging issues, and optimizing site speed and SEO performance.

** Description of the Projects Involved During the Internship
*** Sasto Nordic's e-commerce store
Sasto Nordic was a unique startup selling Nepali products such as food, clothing items in the Danish market, namely
Denmark, Norway and Sweden. They focused on promoting and selling a wide range of Nepali grocery items to recreate
traditional dishes and celebrate Nepali culture. The company collaborated with them to develop an online e-commerce store
with the following features:

- Buyers can:
  + sign up / sign in
  + search for products or view products by category, collection
  + add products to wishlist or to cart
  + checkout products
  + review bought products

- Admins can:
  + add, remove, edit products and their details
  + view users, their wishlists and carts
  + verify, cancel pending orders
  + create discount codes

*** Tarkeshwar Dental's website
Tarkeshwar Dental Clinic needed a website to describe themselves and their services, as well as
publish blog posts to provide information and improve their \acrfull{seo} performance. This was a simple website where
users would come to get information about the clinic, and read blogs related to dental health. 

*** GLOHMED
GLOHMED is a research organization in Nepal, committed to advancing clinical medicine and global health, with a long-term vision to improve quality of patient care and health outcomes in low-resource settings. They had been a long-term client,
with the company having provided various digital services, ranging from website maintenance to graphic design. Their website mainly focused on providing information about themselves, posting about research articles they had published, as well
as providing general updates about the organization.

*** Foreign language exam web app
During my final month, I was tasked to come up with a small project idea, and I deicded to make a web-app for foreign
language exams where non-technical people could easily edit the questions. I was taught how to make project prototypes
quickly using NextJS and SQLite, and as such, I decided to use them to build the project. I decided to
make it after hearing complaints from consultancies and examinees about how there wasn't a well-made app for organizing 
and taking tests for non-English languages like Korean. 

I was able to make a small demo to showcase the potential for such an app using mock questions from Korean EPS language
tests, with a base to further improve it. The demo included the following features:

- Allow admins / exam instructors to easily create question sets through SurveyJS
- Show a list of available question sets to users
- Start timed \acrfull{mcq} test with reading & listening questions
- Automatically grade answers and store test results in a Google Sheet spreadhseet and local database for easy access

** Tasks / Activities Performed
*** Sasto Nordic's e-commerce store
I was given basic tasks for this project to familiarize myself with WordPress, Elementor & WooCommerce, as well as the company's WordPress workflow. I:

- Performed data entry for products in WooCommerce
- Tested responsive issues to ensure the website worked properly on all screen sizes, and fixed them
- Simulated normal user interaction by creating accounts, checking out products and using other features to test for any 
  disruptions in normal user flow
- Setup automated email sender for different actions like resetting passwords, invoices etc.
- Modified and polished templates for the shop page and individual product pages to closely match UI designs

*** Tarkeshwar Dental's website
Due to the project's simple nature, I was asked to work on a majority of it to gain further proficiency in
WordPress-based development. I:

- Discussed with the client and our team regarding client needs, how to achieve them 
- Setup local WordPress development environment for faster, offline development
- Developed the website from scratch and implemented the finalized design 
- Setup automatic templates for blog posts so that the client could easily add new content
- Deployed the website to cloud hosting for collaborating with other developers, sending preview links to client
- Prepared documentation for the client on how to add content, edit the site's design

*** GLOHMED
After becoming proficient in WordPress, I was asked to handle website change requests for GLOHMED, and also perform
routine maintenance. I performed the following tasks: 

- Added new content for posts, research publications, and organisation updates
- Created custom post types to organize posts into Seminars, Conferences & Achievements & migrated old existing posts to
  them
- Improved overall website design by using consistent typography, colors, and modifying the layout to be more modern, while still providing adequate information.
- Performed regular backups, restored backups when a plugin update disrupted the site
- Ran security checks weekly and implemented fixes for vulnerabilities such as disabling unused features like XML-RPC, \acrshort{rest} \acrshort{api}.
- Performed regular plugin updates to ensure security, but only after verifying the update's safety and stability.

- *Website optimization*:
  + Replaced many 3rd party plugins using built-in features in Elementor, custom css 
  + Removed unmaintained, and unnecessary plugins
  + Disabled unnecessary and temporary pages that came with the theme, to ensure they didn't hamper SEO performance, user experience 

- *Email Newsletter Template*:
  + Created an email newsletter template for providing updates to stakeholders.
  + Used the Bricks low-code editor to allow easily creating / modifying new newsletter emails, instead of
    writing HTML-based emails

*** Foreign language exam web app
- Planned implementation details, usecases, and a 1-month timeline for the project
- Designed appropriate database schema for data that would be stored for every completed test, using SQLite.
- Setup automated recording of test results to a Google sheets spreadsheet as well, to allow easy access for non-technical admins.
- Created a basic web app for selecting, running language exams by integrating the SurveyJS library with NextJS
- Created a mock exam template using past Korean language \acrfull{eps} test questions. These included a mix of reading,
  listening \acrfull{mcq}s and were implemented using SurveyJs' \acrfull{json} schema, as shown below:

#+attr_latex: :width 0.7\textwidth
#+attr_org: :height 200px
[[file:img/mcq-json.png]]
#+LATEX:\FloatBarrier

- Setup a SurveyJS project such that non-technical teachers could create new question sets by just duplicating the template
  & editing questions in SurveyJS' visual editor
- Setup time limits, correct answer validation rules, and score system for exams
- Researched and debugged issues with encoding and displaying non-English languages in web browsers
  
* Conclusion and Learning Outcomes
** Conclusion
In summary, this internship involved active participation in the full lifecycle of real-world projects, primarily utilizing
the WordPress platform and associated low-code tools for client website development and maintenance. My contributions
ranged from initial client requirement analysis and project planning to hands-on implementation, deployment, and ongoing optimization. Additionally, I gained introductory experience with modern JavaScript frameworks for building more specialized web applications.

The internship had a few shortcomings, which were:

- Over-reliance on low-code tools that may not be widely used in the industry, potentially hindering future job prospects
- Lack of technically complex projects to challenge and improve interns' skills
- Lack of strict deadlines and management, leading to slight delays

The company should consider these as aspects to improve upon for future interns. Nevertheless, it was a valuable experience
to learn new things as well as solidify previously learned web-development concepts. As such, I am grateful to have
completed this internship as part of my coursework.

** Learning Outcome
Through the course of this internship, I gained practical experience in using the WordPress ecosystem, including its 
php-based core library, theme customization, and utilizing its plugins for building and maintaining client
websites. I developed proficiency in leveraging low-code tools like Elementor to rapidly build websites in a visual manner.
Furthermore, I acquired foundational knowledge in setting up local WordPress development environments, deploying websites
to live servers, and adhering to collaborative development practices. This hands-on engagement provided a tangible
understanding of the process involved in delivering web solutions for real-world clients. Additionally, my brief exposure
to modern JavaScript frameworks such as Astro and Next.js introduced me to alternative approaches for building
more custom, complex web applications. In conclusion, the objectives I had set for this internship were met thoroughly,
improving my skills in modern web development.
