** Micro vs Macro economics
#
*** [focus]
- micro: specific economic entities, markets (individuals, firms)  
- macro: entire economy as a whole (generally of a country)

*** [concerned with]
- micro: supply / demand, consumer behavior, etc.
- macro: national income, inflation, GDP, unemployment etc.

*** [helps in decision-making for]
- micro: individuals, firms
- macro: entire economy, country. Such decisions have repurcussions in all markets

*** [objectives examples]
- micro: suppliers => maximum profit @ min. cost 
         consumers => max. utility
- macro: high GDP, low unemployment

*** [analytical tools]
- micro: elasticity, marginal analysis
- macro: aggregate demand / supply

*** define demand               
quantity of a good / service consumers are willing,
& *able* to buy at a certain price and point of time

*** Determinants of demand
- price
- income / purchasing power of consumers
- type of good (quality, elasticity)
- price of related good
  + substitute
  + complementary
- preference / taste of consumers

** Elasticity

# replace A & B for specific elasticities
for =A= elasticity of =B= (AEB),

**** generic definition
- measure of how =B= responds to change in its determinant =A=, ceteris paribus
- e.g: PED is change in demand caused by change in price

**** generic formula
$\displaystyle AEB = \frac{\%\Delta B}{\%\Delta A}$
or,
$\displaystyle AEB = \frac{\Delta B}{\Delta A} \times \frac{A_1}{B_1}$
# Interpretation: if value is 2%, B changes by 2% for 1% change in A
  
*** ___ Elasticity of Demand
**** Price (PED)
- formula: $\displaystyle PED = \frac{\%\Delta Q^d}{\%\Delta P}$
+ NOTE: use absolute value (non-negative) for PED
  \because price & demand are inversely related (negative)

**** Income (IED)             :drill:

:END:
- types of goods based on IED value:
***** [normal necessary goods ;  0 < IED < 1]
- demand doesn't change much regardless of income change
- as income rises, people spend more on these
  but proportion of income spent on it falls

***** [luxury goods;  IED > 1]
as income rises, 
proportion of income spent on it increases too

***** [inferior goods;  IED < 0]
as income rises, people buy less of these,
preferring to buy better goods

- define:
[change in demand of good X, based on
change in price of  good Y]

- types of goods based on CED value:
***** [substitute goods;   CED > 0]
# same direction of change (both +ve or -ve)
- P_{y}++ => Q^{d}_{x}++  (if price of something increases, consumers look for alternatives)

- P_{y}-- => Q^{d}_{x}--  (if price of something decreases, consumers buy that instead of others)

***** [complementary goods;   CED < 0]
# opposite direction of change 
- if price of sugar increases, people buy less tea
- if discount on sugar, people will buy more tea to go alongside it

***** [neutral (unrelated) goods;   CED = 0]
these do not influence one another

*** Price Elasticity of Supply (PES)
change in quantity produced / supplied by suppliers
due to change in price

# in graph, flatter demand / supply curve => greater elasticity
**** [elastic;     |PEB| > 1]
- small change in P => large change in B 
- for PED: luxury / non-necessity goods
  + small discount => demand++ 
- for PES: easily producable goods
  + small price++ => large supply++ 

**** [inelastic;   |PEB| < 1]
- large change in P required to change B significantly
- for PED: necessities (food items, electricity)
- for PES: difficult to produce goods
  + large price++ needed to incentivize increase in supply 

**** [unitary elasticity;   |PEB| = 1]
proportional / same amount of change

**** [perfectly elastic;    |PEB| = \infin]
- B changes even if no change in P
  (due to external factors?)
- horizontal for PED, PES

**** [perfectly inelastic;  |PEB| = 0]
- B never changes, regardless of change in P
- for PED, represents goods always consumed in fixed quantity (medicine, salt)
- vertical for PED, PES
* ECON3: Theory of Consumer Behavior
** Cardinal utility vs Ordinal utility
|                          | cardinal         | ordinal                          |
|--------------------------+------------------+----------------------------------|
| utility can be measured? | yes, in numbers  | no, but can be compared          |
| e.g.                     | X gives 80 utils | X gives more satisfaction than Y |
| aka                      | utility analysis | indifference curve analysis      |
| practicality             | less             | more                             |
** Cardinal utility
*** Diminishing marginal utility
satisfaction gained from additional unit consumed 
decreases as consumption increases

TU is max when MU=0
*** law of equi-marginal utility
max utility for
**** single product 
** Ordinal utility
*** Indifference curve
graph showing all combinations of 2 goods
that give same lvl. of TU / satisfaction
** TODO exam: price effect is combination of substitution & income. show
write description for utility first
write descriptions of all 3 effects too
** TODO derive demand curve from utility curve
** Income consumption curve (ICC)
line formed by joining all equilibrium points
as income changes
** Price consumption curve (PCC) / Price effect
line formed by joining all equilibrium points
as price changes

budget line is combination of goods possible to buy w/ current income?
+ doesn't care about consumer preference?
  i.e. if Px decreases, budget line rotates outwards in x direction
  regardless if consumer doesn't like good x
*** decomposition
Substitution effect = \Delta Q^{d} from x1 to x2 
Income effect = \Delta Q^{d} from x2 to x3 
**** normal good
**** generally inferior good
**** giffen good
demand is inversely related to income
=|IE| > |SE|=
* ECON4: Cost & Revenue curve 
** Cost
when ATC, intersects with MC, ATC is lowest
cost of producing one more unit is same as average cost
*** TODO exam: Cost types 
skim description
**** direct
**** indirect
**** fixed
**** variable
**** sevi-variable (fixed + variable)
**** practice numerical in head
*** TODO explicit vs implicit costs
|           | implicit                                              | explicit                 |
|-----------+-------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------|
|           | economic, opportunity                                 | financial                |
| recorded? | not recorded                                          | yes                      |
| e.g.      | using own property, family business instead of hiring | cost of materials, wages |
|           |                                                       |                          |
** Revenue
amount of money gained from sales
TR = Q * P
AR = P = $\displaystyle \frac{TR}{Q}$ 
MR = $\displaystyle \frac{\Delta TR}{\Delta Q}$

TR is max when MR = 0
profit is max when MR=MC
** TODO exam: relation of AR & MR
see how it looks in curve as well

- same for perfect competition market
  \because sellers can't change price. only Q changes
- for imperfect:
  + when Q is low, almost same
  + MR slope is 2X steeper so
     as Q increases, MR moves below AR
* ECON5
** TODO exam: market types
*** perfect competition
many sellers of same product
none can change price
ez entry, exit

*** monopoly
single dominates
*** oligopoly
few dominate
slightly different products
*** monopolistic
many firms
each selling different products
ez entry
* ECON6
** TODO exam: look up how to do numericals
