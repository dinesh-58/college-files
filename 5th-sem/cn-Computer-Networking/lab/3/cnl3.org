* Objectives
- to learn about enterprise level routers in depth
- to simulate initial router setup in Cisco PacketTracer

* Theory
One of the main components of the OSI model's Network layer is the router. It is a computer specifically designed for *routing*
(forwarding data packets between different networks). Additionally, it determines the best path for routing packets.

Since a router is just a computer, it has the basic components such as CPU & different types of memory. It also has some
specialized components as shown in the figure below:

** ROM
It stores bootloader instructions which won't be erased even after formatting / wiping the router's data. These are loaded upon powering on the device, which then start up the operating system.

** Flash 
It is a small, non-volatile memory, generally used for storing the router's operating system.
Cisco routers run IOS (Internetwork Operating System), which provides a text-based command line interface for interacting with & configuring the router.
The OS is loaded into RAM to run it. 

** NVRAM
Non-Volatile RAM is used for permanent storage of the router's startup configurations / settings in the =startup-config= file.
One thing to note is that configuration changes are stored in volatile RAM in the =running-config= file.
These must be manually copied into =startup-config= to save them.

** Interfaces
A router consists of multiple interfaces / ports for connecting networks / devices through which data transfer occurs. Some basic ones are:

*** Console

Lab work was done in Cisco Packet Tracer by simulating a basic router(1841) and setting it up through text commands.


* Conclusion
