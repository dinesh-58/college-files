* Objectives
- understand difference between straight-through & cross-over network cable
- practically implement the cross-over cable using clamping tool.
* Introduction 
Ethernet cables belong to the Physical layer of the OSI model and are used to connect devices together in a network.
They can be of 2 types:

- Straight-through
- Cross-over

An un-clamped patch cable consists of 8 smaller color-coded wires. The patch cable can be converted into either of the 2 types based on the wiring standard used i.e. the sequence of organizing and connecting the wires to the RJ45 connectors. 
** Straight-through
It is used to connect a computer to a network hub such as a router. Both ends of the wire must follow the same wiring standard, that can be either T568A or TF68B.

** Cross-over
It is used to connect devices of the same type i.e. computer to coputer, switch to switch etc. Here, one end must use the T568A standard and the other must be T568B.

* Lab Work
** Tools used
- RJ-45 Connector
- Clamping tool
- Twisted pair patch cable
** Procedure
* Conclusion
Thus, we clearly understood the different usecases for straight-through & cross-over network cable.
We also learned how to arrange patch cable into cross-over cabling standard and clamp it by doing so practically.
