*** [ubiquitous nature]
- meaning available anywhere
- traditional commerce is limited by geography

*** [rich content / information]
- can use non-text elements to provide info, demonstration
  & convince user to buy
- images, video, interactive (3d viewer, customize size, color etc.)

*** [info density]
- can set up automatic gathering of large amount of info 
- this can be used for making decisions
  e.g.: what type of product sells, appropriate pricing

*** [personalization]
- show specific products that users might like
- based on:
  + purchasing / browsing history
  + preferences
  + user details (age demographic, gender)

- old protocol for accessing internet from mobile devices on cellular network (mobile data)
- used for old "dumb" phones (Nokia)
- early standard for mobile internet

*** Architecture
- Client device
- WAP gateway
- Web server

*** Working
- browser in *mobile device* sends request to *WAP gateway*, which forwards request to *web server*
- server response (WML code) is returned to device
  + WML(Wireless Markup Language) is XML-like language that renders content optimized for WAP devices
  + superseded by HTML
  + server contains XML which is converted to:
    - WML for WAP browsers
    - HTML for http browsers

- optimization example: WML takes into account slower processing, network speed, small screens w/ 
  + making content look good on small screens,
  + making inputs focusable (due to limited navigation methods)

- e.g: customer data, login details, internal company data

**** [Integrity]
- ensure data correctness
- don't allow to improperly modify (intentionally or accidentally)

**** [Availability]
ecomm services, info must be available to users whenever they need it
+ implement backup power, data backup

*** Authentication
verify if an ecomm entity's identity is real / what it claims to be. example:
+ entity can be user, Ecomm software / client, device

+ hackers may request for some data by making it seem as if it's made by a valid user
+ modified software can make it seem as if they are using the paid version

*** Authorization
- setting up roles & permissions to do specific actions

*** Auditing
- refers to logging / recording user actions
- helps w/ customer support, finding bad actors

*** Non-repudiation
- guarantee that users (both buyers, sellers) can't falsely repudiate / deny services. Examples:
  + seller can't refuse to sell goods after placement of order
  + customer can't refuse to pay after delivery
  + refunds / returns should be given in valid cases

- ensures fair, trustworthy Ecomm
  prevent scam, bad experience

  
** Ecomm security risks
- exploiting vulnerabilities in system
- faking / bypassing payment
*** Malware Attack

:END:
malware is any harmful program or code
**** Technical 
***** Virus
attaches to files / executables & replicates (infects other files)

***** Worms
self-replicates across network
no need to attach

***** Trojan Horses
- malware pretending to be legitimate program
- e.g: cracked software

***** Heartbleed
old vulnerability in OpenSSL
that allowed hackers to steal info from affected servers 

***** DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service)
uses infected devices to
overwhelm a server by making large no. of requests

***** Page hijacking
- redirect to harmful webpage
  using vulnerability (in website, user computer, virus)

***** Botnet
network of compromised devices
used for DDoS, spam

***** Malvertising
ads with malware
free download, fake download buttons

***** Ransomware
encrypts files
& holds them for ransom

****** types
- crypto: use encryption algo to lock file
- locker: lock user out of system
- phishing: spread through phishing emails
- exploit kit: spread thru vulnerabilities
***** Sniffing
- capturing data packets traveling in a network
to find sensitive data

- encryption (like SSL certs) helps mitigate this

**** Non-technical
***** Social Engineering / Phishing
- (exploiting human nature, kindness) 
tricking people into revealing sensitive info,
visiting malicious links,
paying money etc.

***** Pharming
- redirect to harmful webpage
  by manipulating DNS server records 

***** Identity Theft / Fraud
- impersonating someone w/ the purpose of
  + using identity to commit fraud
  + scamming their contacts

***** Spam Attack
frequent, large no. of unwanted messages, emails to
+ promote product
+ share malicious links, malware

:END:
**** Hardware
- Firewall
- Secure routers, network devices
- TPM (Trusted Platform Module) chip on devices
  + (encrypts data)
- physical access to servers, DBs to perform vital tasks

**** Software
- Update software, dependencies to remove vulnerabilities

- Checksum, digital signature to maintain integrity
- MFA, biometric login for authentication

- input validation (both client & server side)
- SSL certificate, VPN for encrypting transferred data 
- Anti-virus

- Server logger (for auditing all actions, reporting suspicious behavior)
  + e.g: report suspicious logins to users
  + Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

- Encryption
  + while sending data through network
  + also encrypt storage devices holding sensitive data

   
* MIS5: E-Payment system
types of e-payment:
** Credit card processing steps
offline: physical card is swiped / scanned
online:  card details are entered in checkout form

- Person gives card details to merchant
- Merchant sends details to card-issuing bank to confirm (thru credit card network)
- Bank accepts or declines
  - If accept, send money to merchant's bank account
- Transaction is succesfull
- Person is asked to pay back the credit by a deadline 
  or pay interest

** E-checking
- digital form of check / cheque 
- automates many steps, more secure compared to physical check
- processing depends heavily on ACH

*** processing
- First, the merchant receives authorization from a customer to charge his - or her bank account, including the amount.
-  Next, the merchant securely transmits the above information to the Authorize.Net Payment Gateway server.
-  If the transaction is authorized, then its information is sent as an ACH
  transaction to the Originating Depository Financial Institution (ODFI).
-  From there, this information is passed to the Automated Clearing House
  (ACH) Network for settlement. The ACH Network identifi es the government
  institution that governs the customer's bank account (known as the Receiving
  Depository Financial Institution (RDFI).
-  The ACH Network instructs the RDFI what to transact. Then, the RDFI
  transfers money from the customer's account to the ACH Network.
-  The money transfer authorization goes to the ACH and to the ODFI, and then to Authorize.Net .
-  The merchant’s account is now credited.

** ACH (Automatic Clearing House)
- network of American banks
- allows digital transfer of money
  w/o need for physical cash, checks

  
*** uses
- direct deposit (salary, government benefits)
- bank to bank transfer 
- automated, recurring bill payments

*** Process
- You initiate the transfer, providing the recipient's bank account details.
- Your bank sends the transfer request to the ACH network.
- The ACH network verifies the information and routes the request to the recipient's bank.
- The recipient's bank credits their account and debits yours for the transfer amount.

** Fiat money
- government-issued & regulated currency (real world money)
  + regulated through interest rates, supply

- not e-payment but:
  + *digital currency* is digital form of fiat
  + many *virtual currencies* can be exchanged for fiat

** Virtual currency
- type of digital currency
  generally not regulated by central bank / government
- exists electronically, used for electronic transactions

*** types (by issuer)

**** Centralized
- regulated by generally issuer of currency
  or maybe even governments, banks
- even some decentralized currencies have centralized aspects,
  such as a group controlling minting of new coins, amount of initial coins etc

**** Decentralized

***** Crypto
- decentralized virtual currency that uses cryptography
to secure & authenticate transactions

- uses blockchain
****** blockchain
- network of large no. of computers.
  + made up of blocks (set of transactions)
- each computer verifies blocks & majority result is taken as truth,
  which theoretically makes it impossible to 
  forge / fake transactions

- mining: verifying & recording transactions
****** advantages
- can be used as global currency
  - comparatively, fiat has hassles, regulations / restrictions
- anonymity (no need for KYC)
- independence from central authority prevents situations like
  fiat money declining due to a country's economy
  + although virtual currencies may have highly fluctuating value due to no regulation as well
*** types (by usecase)

**** Open
can be traded for fiat
**** Closed
can't be traded
used for specific purposes / platforms
examples: reward points, in-game currency

** Mobile banking / digital wallet
type of digital currency
* MIS6: Launching a successfull EC website
** Determining feasibility
*** market analysis
- existing competitors
- target audience
  + is there large no. of people that will use it?
- local or global
- will it work?
*** product analysis
- USP
- profit / business model
*** financial analysis
*** technical analysis
- is idea possible or not
- how complicated
- how skilled experts are required? are they available
** funding techniques
- bootstrap: use own funds
- loans
  + from family, friends
  + banks
- pitch to VCs, investors, shark tanks
- crowdfunding (kickstarter, )
** Cross-selling
selling / promoting similar products
** Up-selling
convincing to buy more expensive product 

* Project: e-commerce site
maybe astro for frontend and just simple php or node for backend
- Try out some guided astro projects first? Maybe that blog crud app saved in tablerone
- for payment gateway, use [[https://docs.khalti.com/khalti-epayment/][Khalti]] or [[https://stripe.com/docs/test-mode][Stripe test mode]]
  + eSewa requires registering as merchant to use
    
** stack
*** frontend
- Astro for templating / folder structure
- React for components / interactivity (don't try learning something like Solid now)
  + Solid solves a lot of react problems but I need more react experience for now
- Tailwind + DaisyUI

*** Backend
- Firebase (don't use alternatives like pocketbase, supabase for now.
  firebase prob has more tutorials)

*** Testing (do only near end, if time)

- [[https://youtu.be/Jv2uxzhPFl4?feature=shared][fireship vid]]
- just do unit tests with jest for simplicity?
  cypress prob overkill for this
