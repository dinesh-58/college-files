*** Managerial skills
| manager level | skill that is more required here                |
|---------------+-------------------------------------------------|
| top           | conecptual (running org, management techniques) |
| middle        | managing people                                 |
| lower         | technical (regarding work the workers do)       |

*** challenges
**** technology
- leverage it
- fast rate of innovation may make current things obsolete

**** workforce diversity
- representation
- give fair chance
- no nepotism, favoritism

**** globalization
- operate / compete on global level
- manage according to global standards
  (fair wages, management techniques like Agile)
**** ethics
- treat workers humanely
- don't harm society, others
**** maintain quality & productivity

* MAN2: Perspectives in Management
** Classical perspective / scientific management 
- developed by Frederick Taylor
- assume workers only have physical & economic needs
  compared to modern theories where social needs, job satisfaction taken into account

- centralized leadership
- profit, producitivity maximization
  + create a step-by-step scientific process for doing work
  + assign tasks to workers based on skill
  + managers analyze where time is wasted & optimize it

*** strengths 
- clear structure for management, operations
- division of labour leads to optimized prodcutivity, smooth flow
- clear definition of employee roles, tasks

*** flaws
- only suitable for assembly lines / factories
- leaves out human relation, creativity
- low job satisfaction, may not be sustainable
*** Frederick Taylor's contributions :exam_q:
- father of scientific management
- before, work used to be done based on "rule of thumb" i.e. guess work / feel
  + he introuduced idea of scientifically measuring
    & working exactly to prevent defects
- wage tied to output (to incentivize productivity)
- standardization; create series of steps for production
- separate management & work responsibilities
  + before, managers used to be involved in work too
** Behavioral perspective
*** Human relations movement / theory
- occured after the world war
- include workers in decision making roles too
- workers have needs & desires too (job satisfaction, recognition)
**** Hawthorne studies
# use this to describe above too
treating workers humanely, being kind
leads to better output

** Quantitaive perspective
making managerial decisions w/ quantitaive data
+ use past data, forecasts
+ use outcomes from decisions to shape future decisions

*** advantages
- help find correlation between factors / metrics
  e.g: price decrease leads to more sales

*** disadvantages
- over-reliance on numeric data,
  always striving to increase numbers

- oversimplification (outcomes can depend on many factors, unquantifiable ones too)

*** Management science theory
# different from scientific management
- uses quantitative theory for decisions
- used in finance, management, HR

*** Operations management
- measures amount of input & output generated
- used for inventory management, quality control

** contingency perspectives / theory :exam_q:
aka situational theory
\because it states there is no "one size fits all"
solution for decision making, managing organization

best solution to a problem depends on many factors like:
- skill & expertise of team / leader
- nature of problem
  - if similar problem was solved previously

*** contributions 
- promote flexibility / adaptability
- improves decision making, confidence
- promotes analyzing problems
- encourages creative, new solutions

*** limitations
- too much time in planning phase only, may be time-waste
- lack of clear guidelines, decision paralysis
- difficult to measure some factors

* MAN3: Planning & Decision Making
process of setting organization's objectives
& deciding how to best achieve them

** Levels of Planning
- Strategic / Corporate (set by top managers)
- Tactical (mid managers)
- Operational (lower managers)

** Planning steps
explain using example scenario for planning
*** setting objectives
#+begin_quote

which is double the current sales.
#+end_quote
*** developing planning premises
- assumptions / conditions / limitations that affect planning
  e.g: government policies regarding tax on freelancing
- used for predicting future events / outcome
  #+begin_quote
The mobile phone company has set the objective of 2,00,000 units sale on the basis of forecast done
on the premises of favourable Government policies towards digitisation of transactions.
  #+end_quote
*** identifying alternative course of action
#+begin_quote
The mobile company has many alternatives like reducing price, increasing advertising and promotion, after
sale service etc.
#+end_quote
*** evaluating alternative course of action
- compare cost, effort, time, outcome
- +ves & -ves
 #+begin_quote
The mobile phone company will evaluate all the alternatives and check its pros and cons.
 #+end_quote
*** choosing best one
#+begin_quote
Mobile phone company selects more T.V advertisements and online marketing with great after sales
service.
#+end_quote
*** implementing plan
#+begin_quote
Mobile phone company hires salesmen on a large scale, creates T.V advertisement, starts online
marketing activities and sets up service workshops
#+end_quote
*** follow-up action

**** Barriers 
- language barrier
- info overload (long emails / meetings where unnecessary info sent too)
- lack of clarity 
- emotion (anger, calm, bored)
- all parties don't participate / aren't active
- delayed comunication in non-verbal:
  for e.g: replying hours later to messages \because busy, timezones

**** ways to enhance effective communication
- just solve above problems
- provide precise, useful info
- use technology to advantage
  + chat apps for non in-person meetings
  + pin messages, announcements for all to see (helpful for future as well)
  + AI summarizer tools
- participate, active listening, give feedback
*** extra info / unimportant: communication Network

how info flows in organization
**** formal (done through formal channels)
- downward (boss to worker)
- upward
- lateral (worker to worker @ same level)
**** informal
gossip, social media posts

* MAN6: Controlling & Total Quality Management
** Total Quality Management
*** Concept
- management approach to maintain high quality of produced goods / services
  thru continuous improvement of production process
- this aims for long term success thru customer satisfaction

*** Components
**** Quality Planning
- Identifying your quality goals and standards
- how to check if these are met, when these are met (e.g: ip rating for waterproof, dustproof)

**** Quality Control
- analyzing and testing quality plans to see if viable
- adjust if necessary
  
**** Quality Assurance
- test product quality before delivering to customer
- role of QA departments / individuals

**** Quality Improvement
- analyze data / results from QA step
- identify pain points that may be hindering quality & implement improvements

*** Principles
**** customer focused
should be main focus
**** total employee involvement
all employees must be on the same page,
aim towards customer satisfaction

**** Integrated
- regardless of departments having different scope, 
  org size & complexity,
- all should understand and work towards main goal
**** Process oriented
- sequence of steps to follow (e.g: assembly line)
- constant improvement / optimization of steps
**** Strategic
- emphasize quality in company's vision / long term plan 

**** Continuous improvement
- even after delivering goods to one customer,
  try to find ways to improve for next customer
  (endless)
**** fact based decision making
collect performance data for analysis, decision making
**** Communication
- clear comms between departments so everyone understands their & others' roles

*** Tools & Techniques

**** Pareto principle
80% of effects caused by 20% of the cause

- 80% of the work can be done by 20% of effort ("good enough")
  + e.g: deliver rough graphic design of entire site first instead of fixating on font
- use to identify what 20% areas have biggest impact on quality & focus on that
- and then decide if it is worth putting more time in

- impact on quality can be:
  + positive: small effort gives biggest result
  + negative: small thing causes biggest problems

**** Check list
basic todo list for steps to take

**** Check sheet
- document for collecting data about specific traits relating to product quality
- can be qualitative or quantitative
- quantitative allows easily visualizing what trait is more prominent
- it is more beneficial if we track defects, instead of successes

- many types of sheets. one such is freqeuncy check sheet
# I used instead of | here for tallying 
| Defect                  | Frequency | Comment                         |
|-------------------------+-----------+---------------------------------|
| wrong delivery addresss | II        | software bug                    |
| missing label           | IIII      | machine stopps working at times |

frequency can be used to prioritize
comments can be used to identify pain points, solutions

*** Emerging Issues in quality management
**** goals, vision must be aligned
- different goals, levels of motivation in a team can cause roadbumps, disrupt smooth flow

**** Remote work & displaced teams
- barrier to effective communication
- timezone differences
- difficult to convey company vision, keep workers motivated virtually 

**** Balancing automation and human resources
- automation can be more effective in terms of cost, time for manufacturing, QA tasks
- but might not be suitable for complex tasks.

**** similar competitors
- many users may "jump ship" if a company makes one misstep or if a competitor provides more features / satisfaction
