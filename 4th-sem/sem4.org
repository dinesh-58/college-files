**** Numerical Double Integration
*** num4: Solution of Linear Algebraic Equation
**** Review of existence of solutions and properties of matrices
**** Consistency of Linear System of Equations
**** Elimination method
***** Gauss elimination
given [A][X] = [B]
****** Elimination phase
- create Augmented matrix [A/B] by simply adding B's values into another column in matrix A & placing ~:~ before the values 
- turn Augmented matrix into upper or lower triangular matrix
  - for upper [U/B], elements below diagonal should be 0 so non-0 values form a triangle in the upper side
- use elementary row operation (performing addition/ subtraction between rows to get required cell values(0) )
- Note: elements from matrix B don't need to be 0. However, their values should be changed as well when performing row operations
****** Substitution phase
put coefficients (x,y,z) for rows in [U/B'] = [X]
***** Gauss elimination w/ pivoting
****** partial pivot
/change rows only/

******* elimination phase
- create augmented matrix [A/B]
- pivot element is =a_{ij}= where i=j
- for column 1 (C1), pivot is =a_{11}=
- in a column, find largest element from pivot to end
- move it to pivot position by swapping rows
- make elements below pivot 0 using row operations
- repeat for other columnns
- Note: /for C2, pivot is =a_{22}= so =a_{21}= is ignored when looking for largest element

******* substitution phase

***** complete pivot
/change both rows & columns/
***** Gauss-Jordan method
no substitution phase
in elimination phase, make all elements except diagonals 0
& put coefficients
***** LU factorization method
***** Inverse of matrix using Gauss elimination
**** Iterative method
***** Gauss-Jacobi
***** Gauss-Seidel
**** Power method
*** num5: Solution of Ordinary Differential Equations
*** num6: Solution of Partial Differential Equations
**** Introduction 
**** Deriving difference equations
**** Laplacian Equation
/if equation = 0/
LHS equation may seem complex but we only care about RHS

if opposite boundary values are equal,
mesh is symmetric 
thus, opposite points will be equal & we only need to calculate few

one point's value = (sum of 4 points across it) / 4
iterate/ repeatedly calculate point values till 2 iterations are
correct upto 3 decimal places & 4th place has difference of 1
***** Gauss Seidel method
values from latest iteration are used

use this cuz easier calc. formula

**** Poisson Equation
/if equation = f(x)/

extra x, y, & mesh length || sub-interval (h) values
    /compared to laplace/
x & y value increase by h (& k if specified)

one point's value = (sum of 4 - h^2 * f(x,y)) / 4
for short question, calculate 4 points
for long question, calculate 9 points

u(x,y) is u value at point (x,y)
    /don't confuse this with x or y values

***** Recall keywords 1st, then details
****** Mono-programming
At a time, main memory can only load OS & 1 process.
Used in early computers
****** Multi-programming
******* Fixed Partition
memory separated into partitions of different partitions.
1 partition holds one process at a time

As process size increases, we need to allocate more memory
******** Continuous allocation
allocating memory in same partition
******** Non-continuous allocation
allocating additional memory from free partition.
link/pointer is used to show in which partition process continues?
******** implemented using
********* Absolute translation
maintain queues for each partition. processes can only run in assigned partition
********* Relocatable translation
use one queue for entire memory.
process runs on whichever partition is free 
******** Drawback
unused memory in partitions (fragment?) if partition size > process size
there may be enough memory to run another process but it may be split up as fragments in different partitions
********* Solution: Memory compaction/ Defragmentation?
- partitions are resized & moved in memory such that there are no fragments
- creates one large empty area for additional processes to run

******* Variable Partition

how does it differ from the mysqli class? 
******* answer 
=mysqli= is only for MySQL databses.

=PDO= provides a consistent interface by using the same class to work w/ a variety of RDBMS software
******* extra info
mysqli uses ~snake_case~,
PDO uses ~camelCase~
***** extra info
- underlying concept of connecting to DB, executing queries, & fetching results (if needed) is same across the 3
- SQLite3 class is also available specifically for SQLite

**** MySQL
**** PDO
# PDO is out of syllabus. was learned for project
***** syntax to connect
#+begin_src php
  <?php
 $pdo = new PDO($driver:$dbName);
 // for SQLite, it would be PDO('sqlite:example.db') 
  
#+end_src
***** PDOObject
returned from PDO::query
****** fetch
****** fetchAll
may take up large amount of memory if reading from large table
thus, better to use fetch w/ loop
****** fetch mode
can be specified for both fetch & fetchAll
******* important ones
- =PDO::FETCH_NUM=
- =PDO::FETCH_ASSOC=
- default is =PDO::FETCH_BOTH= which fetches both numeric and associative array
***** query
