***** question on page 71
***** Recall keywords 1st, then details
****** Mono-programming
At a time, main memory can only load OS & 1 process.
Used in early computers
****** Multi-programming
******* Fixed Partition
memory separated into partitions of different partitions.
1 partition holds one process at a time

As process size increases, we need to allocate more memory
******** Continuous allocation
allocating memory in same partition
******** Non-continuous allocation
allocating additional memory from free partition.
link/pointer is used to show in which partition process continues?
******** implemented using
********* Absolute translation
maintain queues for each partition. processes can only run in assigned partition
********* Relocatable translation
use one queue for entire memory.
process runs on whichever partition is free 
******** Drawback
unused memory in partitions (fragment?) if partition size > process size
there may be enough memory to run another process but it may be split up as fragments in different partitions
********* Solution: Memory compaction/ Defragmentation?
- partitions are resized & moved in memory such that there are no fragments
- creates one large empty area for additional processes to run

******* Variable Partition
