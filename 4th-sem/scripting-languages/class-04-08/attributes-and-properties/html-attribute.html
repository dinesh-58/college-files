        HTML attributes

        In HTML, tags may have attributes. When the browser parses the HTML to create DOM objects for tags, it recognizes standard attributes and creates DOM properties from them.
        So when an element has id or another standard attribute, the corresponding property gets created. But that doesn’t happen if the attribute is non-standard.

        
    -->

    <!--
      Please note that a standard attribute for one element can be unknown for another one. 
      For instance, "type" is standard for <input> (HTMLInputElement), 
      but not for <body> (HTMLBodyElement). 
      Standard attributes are described in the specification for the corresponding element class.

      
    -->

    <!--

      So, if an attribute is non-standard, there won’t be a DOM-property for it. 
      Is there a way to access such attributes?

      Sure. All attributes are accessible by using the following methods:

          elem.hasAttribute(name) – checks for existence.
          elem.getAttribute(name) – gets the value.
          elem.setAttribute(name, value) – sets the value.
          elem.removeAttribute(name) – removes the attribute.

      These methods operate exactly with what’s written in HTML.

      Also one can read all attributes using elem.attributes: a collection of objects that belong to a built-in Attr class, 
      with name and value properties.
