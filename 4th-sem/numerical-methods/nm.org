given: f(x) = 0
  --or-- convert given eqn to this form
find : root (x value where y = 0)
topic: non-linear eqn [bracketing]

*tldr: [keep calculating midpoint]*
***** algorithm

- take 2 initial guessess such that f(x_{1})<0 & f(x_{2}) > 0
  + EZ way is to solve f(x = 1) in calculator
    (to find positive root).
  + then take integers nearest to ans. as x_{1}, x_{2}
  + e.g: if ans = 1, take x_{1}=0, x_{2}=2 

- loop
  + calculate midpoint x3
  + if f(x_{3}) == 0,
    root found, exit loop
    
  + else if f(x_{1}) * f(x_{3}) < 0
    x_{1} = x_{3}   \because root ~ [x_{3}, x_{2}]
  + else
    x_{2} = x_{3}   \because root ~ [x_{1}, x_{3}]
  # basically just use values whose y-values are opposite in sign
- while 2 iterations of x_{3} aren't accurate enough

***** extra info (for making calculation easier)
- easier to understand if you draw that graph
- in calculator, separate midpoint & f(x) formulae with =:=
- while making table for x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3} & f(x_{3}) values,
  write with pencil which column has f(x) < 0
  + then, just place x_{3} there when f(x_{3}) < 0

given: f(x) = 0
  --or-- convert given eqn to this form
find : root (x value where y = 0)
topic: non-linear eqn [bracketing]
***** steps
- similar to bisection but,
  use this formula for =x_{3}= instead of midpoint:

  $x_3 = \displaystyle \frac{x_1 \cdot f(x_2) - x_2\cdot f(x_1)}{f(x_2) - f(x_1)}$
- replace x_{3} using same technique as in bisection
- repeat unitl f(x_{3})=0 or 2 iterations are same upto acceptable error

given: 
| x | x_{0} | x_{1} | x_{2} | x_{3} |
| y | y_{0} | y_{1} | y_{2} | y_{3} |

find y value at certain value of x
use this formula when [x value lies toward *upper* half of table/ range]
***** steps (recall in copy)
- create vertical table with 1 empty line between each row (filled later)
- keep adding difference columns & calculating difference of previous col.
  until col. has only one value (here, col will be Δ^{3}y)
- difference is difference of previous column's values
  that surround current row
  i.e. \Delta y_{0} = y_{1} - y_{0}

- calculate $\displaystyle p = \frac{x_{p} - x_{0}}{h}$
  where, x_{p} is given value for which we need to find y_{p}
  h is interval between x values
- final formula:  $y_{p} = \displaystyle{ \frac{1}{0!}\cdot y_0 \medspace + \frac{p}{1!}\cdot \Delta y_0 \medspace + \frac{p(p-1)}{2!}\cdot \Delta^2 y_0 \medspace + \frac{p(p-1)(p-2)}{3!}\cdot \Delta^3 y_0 }$
***** extra info
- remember that this formula is only when 4 values (of x & y) are given
  do similarly for more or less values
- try to remember patterns:
  - 1 fraction for every y related column 
  - (start denominator =i= from 0!)
  - for a fraction's numerator, subtract from p upto 1 less than =i=
- for ease, put last fraction in calculator & then change slightly for previous fractions

***** differences from forward formula
- difference symbol is \nabla instead of \Delta
- nth value insted of 0th value
  - p uses x_{n} instead of x_{0}
  - final formula uses y_{n} instead of y_{0}
- in final formula, p is *added* with 1,2 etc.

- table values are actually same as forward

# asked only once tbh. seems unimportant

- topic: interpolation
- given: table of x & y values
- asked: to fit straight line
- i.e. just need to [find equation]
**** steps
solved [[https://atozmath.com/example/CONM/LeastSquare.aspx?q=1&q1=E1][example]]
- use normal equations:

     ∑y = a*n + b∑x
  ∑(xy) = a∑x + b∑x^{2}


- from table, calculate required values, sums for above eqns
- substitute values in normal eqns & solve to find =a, b= values
- substitute in straight line eqn
  ~y = a + bx~ to get answer
**** extra info (EZ ways to remember)
- 1st normal eqn is variation of straight line eqn
- 2nd normal eqn can be rememberd as
  just multiplying everything in 1st by x,
  except for =a=, swapping n with ∑x

given: 3 equations using ~x,y,z~ or similar variables
       that can be written in ~[AX = B]~ matrix form
find : ~x,y,z~ values
**** Elimination phase
- create Augmented matrix [A/B'] by simply placing B's values
  into another column in matrix A & placing colon(:) before the values 

- turn Augmented matrix into upper or lower triangular matrix
  - e.g: for upper triangular [U/B'], elements below diagonal should be 0
    so non-0 values form a triangle in the upper side
- use elementary row operation (performing addition/ subtraction between rows)
  to turn required elements to 0 

/Note: elements from matrix B don't need to be 0.
However, their values will change as well when performing row operations/

**** Substitution phase
- multiply coefficients(numbers) in [U] with (x,y,z)

topic: linear eqn
given: 3 equations using ~x,y,z~ or similar variables
       that can be written in ~[AX = B]~ matrix form
find : ~x,y,z~ values
**** this is for partial pivot
/swap rows only/

complete pivot swaps both rows & columns
but seems out of syllabus

**** elimination phase
- create augmented matrix [A/B]
- pivot element is diagonal element
- in a column, find largest element below pivot
- move it to pivot position by swapping rows
- make elements below pivot/ diagonal 0
  using row operations
  /basically Upper triangular matrix [U/B']/
- repeat for other columnns

Note: for C2, pivot is a_{22} so a_{21} is ignored
when looking for largest element

**** substitution phase
same as w/o pivot
just multiply coefficients by variables
- turn into ~[A][X] = [B]~ form and solve

       that can be written in ~[A][X] = [B]~ matrix form
find : ~x,y,z~ values

**** steps (similar to Gauss Elim. but shorter)
- no substitution phase
- in elimination phase, turn augmented matrix [A/B'] into unit/Identity matrix
- i.e. all diagonals 1,
       non-diagonals 0

  | 1  0  0  : b_{1} |
  | 0  1  0  : b_{2} |
  | 0  0  1  : b_{3} |

- b values will change as we perform row operations
- ~x,y,z~ are directly equal to b values

**** decomposition phase
- take L & U triangular matrices
- for non-0 elements, put variables like L_{1}, L_{2}
- turn all diagonals for one of the matrices to 1
- use ~[A] = [L][U]~ & solve to find triangular matrix values

**** substitution phase

- take lower triangular matrix L (with elements above diagonal being 0)
- for non-0 elements, put variables like L_{1}, L_{2} 
- take L^{T} (transpose of L)
  - just flip/ swap rows with columns

topic: linear eqn
given: 3 equations using ~x,y,z~ or similar variables
       that can be written in ~[A][X] = [B]~ matrix form
find : ~x,y,z~ values

*** common steps for both Seidel & Jacobi 
- derive eqns/ formulae for each variable
- from 1st eqn, derive for x_{1}
  from 2nd, derive x_{2} etc. 
- put formulae in calculator
  separated by colon(:)
- write each iteration's values in table
- take initial values 0
*** Gauss-Seidel
- simpler calculator formula
- use latest/ current iteration values
- in calculator, just put the 3 derived formulae & solve
*** Gauss-Jacobi
- use previous iteration values
- in calculator, if required variables are =x,y,z=
  - use placeholder variables =a,b,c= in the formulae
  - like ~x = f(a,b)~
  - set =a,b,c= equal to =x,y,z= after the formulae
  - this allows placeholders to use previous iteration values

topic: linear eqn
given: matrix A
find:  eigen vector/ matrix(X) & eigen value(\lambda)

*** steps
- main formula: $A\cdot X_i = \lambda_{i+1}\cdot X_{i+1}$
- take initial guess X_{0} having same no. of rows as A,
  & one column
- for X values, 
  + if any value of row 1 in A  is 0,
    1st row value of X is 0
  + else, if all non-zero,
    X is 1
  + repeat for other rows
- multiply A & X_{0}
- from the product, take largest value common
  so that it turns into above formula form
- loop until \lambda & X of 2 iterations are accurate upto specified decimal places

*** extra info (calculator steps)
- use matrix mode (Mode 6)
- define A as MatA
  & X_{0} as MatB
  using =Shift 4= (it says Matrix above it)
- do =MatA * MatB= only once
  product stored in =MatAns=
- loop
  + =MatAns / largest matrix value (eigen)=
    MatAns is now eigen vector
  + =MatA * MatAns=
- until \lambda & X of 2 iterations are almost accurate
  (difference of last decimal place is 1)

*for quicker results, write only 3 decimals
(i.e. accurate upto 2 decimals)*

- given: differential eqn ~y' = f(x)~ 
           i.e. 1st order derivative
         y_{0} value
- find : y at specified x value
- hint : formula kinda similar to [[[*Newton's *divided* difference formula][Newton's *forward* difference formula]]]
*** steps
- find formulae for 2nd & 3rd order derivative as well
- formula:  $\displaystyle{ \frac{1}{0!}\cdot y_0 \medspace + \frac{x-x_0}{1!}\cdot y'_0 \medspace + \frac{(x-x_0)^2}{2!}\cdot y''_0 \medspace + \frac{(x-x_0)^3}{3!}\cdot y'''_0 }$
  + here, y_{0}''' = f'''(x_{0})
- similar pattern to newton's forward but:

  + derivative instead of difference
  + we increase power of (x - x_{0})
    instead of subtracting with others
  + formula *always* goes upto i=3 i.e. 3rd order derivative?
